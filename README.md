- Trainers can create, edit, and manage training sessions with details such as date, time, and location.
- Participants can view and edit training sessions.

### User Profiles and Communication:
- Participants can manage their profiles.

### Responsive Design:
- User-friendly web interface optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Plan
### Total Duration: 15 weeks

### Phase 1: Initiation and Planning (2 weeks)

   - Introduce the project team and key stakeholders.
   - Present the project plan and objectives.
   - Ensure team members understand their roles and responsibilities.
   - Encourage open communication and collaboration.

2. **Understand Requirements and Scope:**
   - Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.
   - Define the scope of the project, including features and functionalities.

3. **Assemble Project Team and Roles:**
   - Identify and assign roles to team members based on their skills and expertise.
   - Ensure a balanced and cross-functional team.

4. **Develop Project Charter and Kickoff Meeting:**
   - Create a project charter outlining goals, objectives, and key stakeholders.
   - Conduct a kickoff meeting to align the team with the project vision.

5. **Set Up Communication Channels and Tools:**
   - Establish communication channels (Slack, email, etc.).
   - Set up project management tools for collaboration (Jira, Trello, etc.).

6. **Create Project Plan and Schedule:**
   - Develop a detailed project plan with milestones and timelines.
   - Assign tasks to team members based on their roles.

7. **Identify Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**

### Phase 2: Backend Development (5 weeks)
1. **Setup Backend Environment and Tools:**
   - Install JDK, choose an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
   - Create a project folder, initialize a Git repository.
   - Set up a build tool (Maven or Gradle) and Spring Initializr.
   - Configure database connection and server environment.

2. **Design Data Models and Database Schema:**
   - Identify main entities (User, TrainingSession, Registration, etc.).

   - Configure database migration tool.
   - Apply data validation, constraints, and unit testing.
     - If your JpaRepository interface mainly uses the default methods provided by Spring Data JPA, and the queries are simple CRUD operations, you might rely on the testing done by the Spring Data JPA team. In this case, writing additional tests might be redundant. If you have custom query methods defined in your JpaRepository, especially complex queries involving joins, aggregations, or specific business logic, it's beneficial to write tests to ensure these queries return the expected results.
